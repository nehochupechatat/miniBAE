![Alt text](docs/block.jpg)

### Why do we care?
Nostalgia.

### What can it be used for?
Playing just about any kind of audio content. Either stored locally, via a network stream or stored in an application.
From the application, there are all kinds of ways to hook into the media as it plays.
User feedback for visually impaired. Sonified UIX.
Instantly create musical instruments out of any device or screen.

### What’s is cost?
 Free. BSD license.

### What happened to Beatnik?
 Beatnik ended business December 2009. Decided to release the miniBAE source as a BSD license rather than let it disappear.

### What’s with all this Javascript code?
 miniBAE’s first incarnation was a plugin for web browsers than included almost a feature for feature Javascript API to match the native API’s. That code is also in the release for potential reuse in Browsers or Frameworks that support Javascript.

### What’s left to be done?
 If the Javascript code is to be used, it will have to be modernized, and a layer between Javascript and the Native code will have to be written.
 A Native Host will have to be written for each platform you want to support. The code release includes Mac OSX, Windows, iOS.
